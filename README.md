This is the API necessary for the Oxypi Project I'm developing.
This API pretends to follow HL7 FHIR standrad communication (at level 7 of OSI) with DTSU2 version. However, this is not a full
implementation of a FHIR Server. This is focusing in the Observation, Patient and Device resources of FHIR standard.
